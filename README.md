<hr>
Legally Distinct Animal Crossing, which I'm going to shorten to LDAC for this README is a small game I wrote in Godot!

# About
In this game you work for the A.C.A. (Animal Crossing Agency), where you need to help animals cross the road so they dont get hit by oncoming traffic and dissapear! You do this by using the *Control panel*! It has buttons so you can close and open gates for the animals! It's also my first game made in Godot, so forgive me for any bugs.

## Misc Gameplay Info
- Gates close automatically after 6 seconds
- Some animals can have a higher speed stat than others
- Cars only slow down when one or both gate(s) is fully open

## How to play
Download the game or play it in your browser (buggy) from the [itch.io page](https://j4y-boi.itch.io/ld-animal-crossing).

## Known Bugs
- Lighting is very broken on web
- Random lag spikes on web
- Particles appearing on a delay
